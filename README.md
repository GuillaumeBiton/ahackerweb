Refactoring hackerweb (HTML5 app from Lim Chee Aun) with Angular.JS

# About

I'm a huge fan of Lim Chee Aun ([cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun)) work on a HTML5 app named [hackerweb](https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb). The hard work to make the app mobile friendly is very interesting. The author spend time to create or integrate libraries and I learned a lot looking at the code.

I'm also impressed by the Angular.JS framework and I play a lot with it.

So I decided to refactor hackerweb app with Angular.JS, as a game and a learning purpose.

My goal is to be as close as possible from the original app, only using Angular.JS framework capacities.

# Dependencies

It depends on the last (non-stable) release of Angular.JS Framework.

# Done

Working app using cheeaun's web css theme.

# To do

Make it working with cheeaun's iOS css theme.
